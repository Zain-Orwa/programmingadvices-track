# 🚀 Algorithms Level 3 – 50 Advanced Problems in C++

Welcome to my **Level 3 Algorithm Challenge** — a curated collection of **50 advanced algorithmic problems** solved in **C++**.  

🎯 **Goal**: Master complex data structures, optimize performance, and strengthen problem-solving intuition — one problem at a time.

🔁 **Flexible Pace**: I solve problems at my own rhythm — whether it's 1 per week or 10 in a weekend. Progress > perfection.

All solutions are written in  C++ (C++11+) and organized for clarity and reusability.
