/*
 Problem 02
 ==========
 Create a program that reads a year from the user and checks whether it is
a leap year based on the Gregorian calendar rules using a clear step-by-step
if/else structure.

 Notes
 =====
 - A leap year is:
     * Divisible by 400  → leap year.
     * Divisible by 100 (but not by 400) → not a leap year.
     * Divisible by 4 (but not by 100) → leap year.
     * Otherwise → not a leap year.
 - Functions:
     * `ReadYear()` – reads input from the user.
     * `IsLeapYear()` – implements the conditional logic explicitly.
 - Demonstrates structured control flow and logical ordering of conditions.
 - This version focuses on clarity and step-by-step reasoning.
