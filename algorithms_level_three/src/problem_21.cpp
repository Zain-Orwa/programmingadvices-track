/*
 * Problem 33 to 64
 * ================
 * Create programs that read a date (day, month, year) and demonstrate how to
 * decrease it by different time spans: days, weeks, months, years, decades,
 * centuries, and millennia.
 *
 * Notes
 * =====
 *- Leap years follow the Gregorian rule (February has 29 days in leap years).
 *- Helper functions handle month lengths, clamping days, and rolling back months/years safely.
 *- Each decrement function composes simpler ones (day → week → month → year).
 *- Some functions in this section depend on the increase functions from previous problems.
 *- This code is intended to teach function composition; it is not optimized.
